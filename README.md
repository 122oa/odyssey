**machinarium**

Machinarium allows to create fast networked and
event-driven asynchronous applications in synchronous/procedural
manner instead of using traditional callback approach.

The library is based on using and combining OS threads
(pthreads) and efficient cooperative multi-tasking primitives
(coroutines).
